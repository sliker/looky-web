                <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>

                <p>Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or
                    mobile device that uniquely identifies your browser or device. We may use technologies like cookies,
                    pixels and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products, services, and ads.</p>

                <p><strong>What are cookies used for?</strong></p>

                <p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or services to know if your computer or device has visited it
                    before. These technologies can then be used to deliver products, services, and ads, help us understand
                    how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help remember your
                    preferences, and generally improve your experience in using our services. Cookies can also help ensure
                    marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

                <p><strong>Why does Looky use cookies and similar technologies?</strong></p>

                <p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve
                    your experience, and help protect Looky and our users. We may use these technologies to deliver the
                    service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enables you to move around the Service and use
                    its features, such as accessing secure areas, and store information so that Looky responds faster. We
                    may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the Service, for example which pages
                    you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages. We may use these technologies to
                    allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and
                    tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you. These cookies can also be used to
                    remember changes you've made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customize. Looky
                    or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your
                    interests. These technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also
                    be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than Looky. This
                    information may be shared with organizations outside Looky, such as advertisers and/or advertising
                    networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. *
                    We may use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products and services.</p>

                <p><strong>How long will cookies stay on my device?</strong></p>

                <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a
                    "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.
